# Nav2 F1 Task (Python3) Commander

## Overview

The goal of this package is to provide a "navigation as a library" capability to Python3 users. We provide an API that handles all the ROS2-y and Action Server-y things for you such that you can focus on building an application leveraging the capabilities of Nav2. We also provide you with demos and examples of API usage to build common basic capabilities in autonomous mobile robotics.
